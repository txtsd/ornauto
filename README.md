# ornauto

ornauto is an autoplayer for the geolocation based game Orna.

It grinds battles, arenas, kingdom raids, and upgrades your gear at the blacksmith.

It isn't fully automatic yet. It is designed to be run in-between your real play sessions.

GPS spoofing hasn't fully been figured out yet, so use with caution.
